    <h1>IoT Applications</h1>
    <h2>SIT209 - Developing Iot Systems</h2>
    <br>
    <p> Name: Deepali</p>
    <p> Roll No: 2110994843</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Summary of Activity-1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In this part we discussed about an Iot Application, which is basically a network of internet-connected softwares able to collect and exchange data using embedded sensors.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The main features need for an Iot Applicationare: Security, Intelligence, Integration,Accuracy, Dynamic Nature, Quality, Real-Time data. Some examples of </li>
      <br>
      <li>Some examples are: Smart Homes, Smart Parking Systems, Smart Healthcare Systems, Smart parking systems etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Summary of Activity-2</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In this part we explored the idea of creating a smart building. The smart word here means ways in which we're combing traditional systems with recent technology to create an efficient and secure product</li>
      <br>
      <li>Now the smart building can include various sub-applications such as:
        <ul>
        
          <li>Smart Parking System for reserving a parking spot for people</li>
         <li>Emergency Evacuation System for finding safe exits during emergency situations </li>
         <li>Smart Guest Guidance System to automate the guest check-in process</li>
         <li>Personal Tracking System for keeping a record of each individual in the building and record their preferences</li>
         <li>Smart Security System for survelliance with technologies like face detection for safety purposes</li> 
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>The main features of this application can be:Security,Sensor Technology,Energy,Cloud Storage, Quality</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Summary of Activity-3</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>In this part we discussed about the Control Interface of the Smart Building, its users and the possible technologies that can be used.</li>
      <br>
      <li>If we talk about the targeted demographic, that would be the residents of the building, the staff and the visitors. These people will be the users of this system </li>
      <br>
      <li>Now, for the production several technologies will have to be used. 
        <ul>
          <li>Smart Parking system - The number of parking spaces would be recognised by IR sensors. The number of available and reserved spaces would be clearly shown on an LCD panel. A WIFI module would be used to communicate with the mobile app and the sensors.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Smart Security system - The utilisation of AI to improve the functionality of gadgets like doorbells, smart lights, CCTV cameras, and fire sensors will be done.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
